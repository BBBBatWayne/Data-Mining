PREREQUISITES:

==============

python 2.7 or more

python numpy

python math

training set on top of the directory

necessary path updation to load the training file



Code works as follows:

======================

1. Run the python script "recSys.py" in the terminal or unix shell using the command "python recSys.py"

2. The code generates the test file with name "recSysTest.txt".

3. Later after generating the test file, an intermediate test file with the name "recSysTestOut_itemcf.txt"

4. Now finally, the output file with predictions will be generated based on the specified file name 

5. The file name is as follows "RecSysOutput_itemcf.txt"

6. The above generated file is the output for the test test along with the complete set of users and items. 

7. There are 943 users and 1682 items in the file. Each of the (userID, itemID) has a rating. 




OUTPUT:

=======

Output file generated in the name "RecSysOutput_itemcf.txt"

RMSE for item based collaborative filtering: 1.235128
